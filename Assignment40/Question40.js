// // Question40
// // Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds a Object describing a music album. 
// The function should take in an artist name and an album title, and it should return a Object containing these 
// two pieces of information. Use the function to make three dictionaries representing different albums. 
// Print each return value to show that Objects are storing the album information correctly. 
// Add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you to store the number of tracks on an album. 
// If the calling line includes a value for the number of tracks, add that value to the album’s Object. 
// Make at least one new function call that includes the number of tracks on an album.
